Computer Vision Prediction

Problem Statement:The HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") datasetconsists of 10,015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set foracademic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISICarchive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisonswith human experts.

It has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below :
1. Melanocytic nevi
2. Melanoma
3. Benign keratosis-like lesions
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Actinic keratoses
6. Vascular lesions
7. Dermatofibroma

Your job is to design a classifier using Deep Learning to distinguish among these 7different types of skin cancer when fed an input image. You can use AutoML if you wish,but you must outline your results clearly.
